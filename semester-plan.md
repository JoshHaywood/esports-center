# Semester plan

## Project name - esports center

## Main Features

- Local team registration with some form of validation to prevent spam.
- Upvoting system to change order of results.
- SQL database search and filtering.

## Structure

- React, Front end libary.
- 0Redux, Memory management.
- Express.js, Back end.
- MySQL database.
- MUI - UI libary.

## Methodology

The choosen methodology is agile as sprints provide the ability to reflect and revise various sections.
large enough time frame to not have to use methodologies like waterfall and implement week long sprints effectively.

### Sprint timings

Sprints will last one week starting again from each Monday and deadlining for Sunday, unless extensions are provided.
Stand-ups will be held on tuesdays as this is our first timetabled session of the week. Although this is subject to change depending on timetabling.

## Milestones and stretch

The three milestones we wish to complete by the end of the semester are as follows: 
Local team registration for new users to add to database and pull statstics from new registers.
Upvoting system to filter the order of results based on upvoting hierarchy.
SQL database to store all stastical data and can be correctly searched through, with data able to be filtered based on the users input.

With the stretch goal being to either: 
Use an API such as twitch to steam live matches directly on the website.
Refactor the upvoting system to work based on AI generated suggestions rather than manual upvoting.

## Team roles

Louis - Database
Yordan - back-end
Josh - Front-end
Danny - Full-stack

All tasks will be split up accordingly across the kanban based on the team roles. Following agile and the spring timings.
